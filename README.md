# unicornemu

This project provides an emulator for the Pimoroni Unicorn Hat for use from Scratch programs. It uses the same Scratch Remote Sensor Protocol message definitions as those used by CympleSi's scratchGPIO handler. It uses GTK+ 3 and Cairo for rendering the led matrix colours. Using cairo provides a very easy way of providing an easily extensible interface from scratch to do powerful graphical operations on the led matrix display. At the moment I am just concentrating on getting the emulator to match Simons protocol. The first outing a couple of weeks ago at Cockerham Parochial School in Lancashire for a key stage two class was great fun but suffered from a few problems. For the next outing in a few days time (16/7/15) I hope to introduce a multiscreen version that will show thumbnails for what other Scratch users on the same local network are doing (using ZeroConf/MDNS).
